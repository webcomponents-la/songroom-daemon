# Songroom Daemon

This companion app handles the server-side processing needed for Songroom.

## Getting Started

Clone the app and install dependencies:

    npm install
    
Next you'll need to create a `.env` file. The required variables are exemplefied
in `.env.example`, so it can be easy to just `cp .env.example .env` and start
from there.
